      <h2>Lore</h2>
      <p>Priests practice a complex, organized form of spirituality. It can be built around moral philosophy, the worship of a particular deity (such as Elune), and/or idol worship. This is in contrast to the reverence of the elements that shamans practice or the close divine connection with animals and the wilderness that druids maintain. Priests serve not only as influential religious figures in their respective societies, but also as powerful practitioners of divine magic. They use this to heal and protect, or harm and weaken.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Devotion to the faiths of Azeroth leads many priests to the paths of courage and heroism. In dark times, priests carry the Light of faith with them as a reminder of the powerful forces at work beyond the comprehension of the peoples who walk the land. Powerful healers with an intimate connection to the divine, priests are empowered with abilities that aid them in times of dire need.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Priests comprise quite a varied group in Azeroth. Many are followers, in some manner, of the Holy Light. Some priests choose to be pyremasters or High Priests, while some of the most experienced become epic priests. There are also racial restrictions to some titles, such as witch doctor for trolls and Priestess of the Moon for night elf females.</p>
